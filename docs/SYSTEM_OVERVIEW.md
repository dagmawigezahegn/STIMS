## üéì How Students, Courses, and Records are Managed

### 1. **Student Management**
Students are at the core of the STIMS system. The system allows for efficient management of student data, including registration, academic records, and course enrollments.

- **Registration**:
  - New students are registered by admins, who input details such as name, date of birth, email, and program.
  - A unique student ID is generated automatically (e.g., `ID/GRA/25/001`).
  - A temporary password is created and stored in a file (`temporary_password_student.txt`).

- **Academic Records**:
  - Academic records include semester-wise details such as total credits, Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA), and Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA).
  - Admins can add, update, or delete academic records for students.
  - The system automatically calculates SGPA and CGPA based on the grades entered by teachers.

- **Course Enrollments**:
  - Students are enrolled in courses by admins.
  - Each enrollment is linked to a specific course offering, which includes details like academic year, year, and semester.
  - Students can view their enrolled courses and grades through their dashboard.

- **Profile Management**:
  - Students can update their profile information, such as email, phone number, and address.
  - They can also change their username and password.

   - Manage navigation between different views (e.g., dashboards, forms).

2. **Models**:
   - Represent the data entities (e.g., Student, Course, Teacher).
   - Encapsulate the business logic and data validation.

3. **Database Access Objects (DAOs)**:
   - Provide methods for interacting with the MySQL database.
   - Handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for all entities.

4. **Utilities**:
   - Utility classes for common functionality (e.g., password hashing, file path handling).

5. **Reports**:
   - Classes for generating and managing reports (e.g., academic transcripts, course reports).

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema
The system uses a MySQL database with the following key tables:

1. **`admin`**: Stores admin user details.
2. **`course`**: Stores course details.
3. **`courseoffering`**: Stores course offerings for specific academic years.
4. **`department`**: Stores academic department details.
5. **`grade`**: Stores student grades for specific courses.
6. **`program`**: Stores academic program details.
7. **`role`**: Stores user roles (e.g., admin, teacher, student).
8. **`student`**: Stores student details.
9. **`student_reports`**: Stores student-generated reports.
10. **`studentacademicrecord`**: Stores academic records for students.
11. **`studentcourse`**: Stores student enrollments in courses.
12. **`teacher`**: Stores teacher details.
13. **`teachercourse`**: Stores teacher assignments to courses.

### Default Values in the Database
The `schema.sql` file comes with default values for certain tables to ensure the system is functional upon initial setup:

1. **Role Table**:
   - The `role` table is pre-populated with the following roles:
     - **Super Admin**
     - **Admin**
   - These roles are essential for system administration and cannot be modified or added through the user interface.

2. **Program Table**:
   - The `program` table is pre-populated with the following programs:
     - **Undergraduate**
     - **Graduate**
   - Similar to roles, these programs are fixed and cannot be modified or added through the user interface. 

3. **Department Table**:
   - The `department` table is pre-populated with the following departments:
     - **Software Engineering**
     - **Information Technology**        
     - **Computer Science**               
     - **Information Technology Systems** 
   - Unlike roles and programs, departments can be added directly through the database. This flexibility allows institutions to customize the system according to their organizational structure.

---

## üîí Security and Data Privacy
1. **Password Hashing**:
   - Passwords are hashed using secure algorithms (e.g., bcrypt).
   - Temporary passwords are securely generated and hashed before storage.

2. **Session Management**:
   - User sessions are managed securely to prevent unauthorized access.

3. **Data Validation**:

---

## üéØ Conclusion
STIMS is a **robust and scalable system** designed to streamline the management of student, teacher, and course-related data. Its **modular architecture**, **secure authentication**, and **comprehensive reporting features** make it ideal for educational institutions. Default values for roles (Super Admin, Admin) and programs (Undergraduate, Graduate) ensure smooth setup but cannot be modified, as the core logic depends on them. However, departments can be added or customized, providing flexibility while maintaining system stability.
